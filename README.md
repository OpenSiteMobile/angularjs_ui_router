AngularJS UI-Router Module Demo using MobileSiteOS version of AngularJS

This is a demo page of the Angular-UI-Router module (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) using our version of AngularJS scripts and modules. It demonstrates and tests the compatiblilty of our MobileSiteOS version of AngularJS with Angular-UI-Router. Please note, the MobileSiteOS version of AngularJS required that we also modify the Angular-UI-Router code for $q and $qq injected variables. There may also be other "slight improvements or tweaks" which are not found in the standard base code.
